    Welcome to Onyx
</h1>

<p style="color:red">* Onyx is currently in early stages of development, and thus it's functionality is limited and there may be unknown bugs/vulnerabilities, proceed with caution</p>

<h2>What is Onyx?</h2>
<p>
    Onyx is designed to be my personal at home assistant. Over time it will be encorporated with many features in order
    to serve it's functions. These will include but not be limited to: increased commands, language processing (both programmatically and 
    using ML models), smart home control, and much more. Over time I hope to make this a very functional AI, and it will be specialized to my life.
    However, I'm sure that other people would see a use for such a tool and therefore it will be available for use by other people who may
    specialize the code for their lives.
</p>

<h2>Why Make Onyx?</h2>
<p>
    A few reasons. The first is that a functional assistant AI is a very fun project to work on because of how modular it is. 
    There are so many mini projects that I can do that only increase the functionality of this one. It's a good way to turn my tangents and
    side projects into somethings productive.
</p>
<p>
    Secondly, while there are many other AI assistants out there, I want to make one that is fast, efficient, and specialized towards my needs. 
    Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri, Cortana etc. are all very advanced and have a lot of tools at their disposal, with giant developer teams to 
    increase their functionality every year, but I don't need all of that stuff. I find myself barely using the functionality that these services
    provide as is, and so by making my own I hope to make it much more useful in my personal life than the other assistants are.
</p>
<p>
    Lastly and most importantly is the issue of privacy. Because the main assistants are built and maintained by big tech companies that make money 
    selling user data, the voice assistants are essentially advanced data collection machines. If I want to make an AI and let it do very specific things
    in my personal life, I don't want it to be reporting data about those things to Google, Amazon, etc. I want to feel safe knowing that I'm the one 
    with control over my assistant data.
