Recognize:
This does what it says, provides functions to recognize different types of input so that we can pick the corresponding output

Response:
This provides functions to generate a response to a given input

Router:
This takes an input, and matches it to the corresponding response to be created.

Creating new IO:

1. Add a new recognition function to the recognize class
2. Add a new response type to the response class
3. Connect them via the router class
